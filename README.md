Proposed rules to allow candidates to earn a living while campaigning

## the idea

The political class disproportionately draws candidates from a wealthy background. This is at least in part due to the fact that campaigning, on the part of the candidate, must be a volunteer occupation. Current campaign finance laws prevent candidates from using campaign funds for personal use, stemming from a history of abuse. This prohibition disproportionately discourages those that must work for a living, and undervalues the contribution of our candidates to the vitality of our democracy.

Let's flip the lens and consider candidates' contributions as a legitimate occupation that should be paid work, and even worthy of a severance package in the case that a candidate loses an election. Under this lens, failing to pay one's self but living directly off capital is neglecting to record the transfer of capital to the campaign and subsequently failing to claim that as income from the campaign.

Anyway, this is an attempt to lay down what might be a reasonable balance that can provide candidates a living income to lessen the economic hardship that candidates face, and provide daylight to how candidates account for their time campaigning.

Now, read [the proposed rule](Rule.md).
