Candidates must draw a salary or wage from the campaign for their time performing duties for the campaign, such as campaigning, fundraising, and managing the campaign. Candidates must choose the wage option if they are splitting their time with another occupation (to include but not limited to: waged or salaried employment, or managing wealth). Candidates may choose the salaried option if they take a break from all other occupations. Candidates taking the salaried option may also provide themselves a severance package in the case of losing an election where the severance can be up to the lesser of the duration they were on salary or 12 months at the same pay rate. The pay rate must be between minimum wage and 2 times the regional median household income. The income may be paid out of any combination of: political party funds, a candidate's personal fundraising, or public funding, as available.

The salary and severance package must be made publicly available by submission to the appropriate government campaign financing or elections department which then must publish it in a timely manner. Failure to comply on the part of the candidate, candidate's representatives, or election officials will be considered a misdemeanor.

The work on a campaign by a candidate is employment to be considered as such in regards to unemployment insurance.

In the case a campaign becomes insolvent, the candidate is one of the creditors with claims against the campaign and treated the same as any other employee during bankruptcy proceedings.
